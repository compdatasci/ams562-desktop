Welcome to the Docker image for AMS 562: Intro. to Scientific Programming!

This image is based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, with GCC-7.3, VScode, LAPACK, boost, vim,
ddd, valgrind, Eigen, OpenMPI, OpenMP, Jupyter, and xeus-cling, preinstalled.

Please save your code and data into the ~/shared or ~/project directories.
The former maps to the current work directory on your computer. The latter
maps to a Docker data volume named ams562_project on your host.

To use git with ssh authentication, make sure the ssh key on your host computer
is in bitbucket and github, and then run "ssh-add" in this terminal to add your
ssh key to the ssh-agent.

Happy coding!
